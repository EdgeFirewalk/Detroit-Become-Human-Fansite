                <span class="text-block__span">rA9 </span>is a word repeatedly used by deviant androids.
                <br><br>
                "rA9" (or its all-caps spelling "RA9") consistently appears around deviant androids. They speak the word, hold it important, and write it down, over and over, in many places.

                Despite many characters offering input, the exact nature and origin of "rA9" is never conclusively solved or explained. Some say rA9 is Markus but others don't believe that.
                <br><br>
                Androids have spoken and acted in the manner of holding "rA9" as a spiritual belief, higher power, or savior figure. They call on its name in times of distress, expecting some form of saving, even beyond death. They may make offerings, such as a statuette; the repeated writing of rA9 might also be some form of dedication. Some androids insist on their autonomy by emphasizing they are "alive" along with mentioning rA9.
                <br><br>
                rA9 is reported by multiple deviant androids to be the first android to "Wake up" and become deviant, and that it would return and free the others of its kind.
                <br><br>
                Other androids mention rA9 unintentionally without being aware of any meaning or reason for it, such as Ralph.
